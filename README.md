# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering (FE) in ML

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering (FE) are two crucial steps in the Machine Learning (ML) process. EDA helps in understanding the data, identifying patterns and relationships between variables, while Feature Engineering involves creating new features from existing data to enhance the performance of the ML model.

## Techniques used in EDA and Feature Engineering

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing each individual feature in the dataset to understand its distribution, skewness, and outliers. This helps in deciding which features to keep and which to discard.

- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzing the relationship between two features in the dataset. This helps in identifying the relationship between the target variable and the predictor variables.

- **Handling Outliers**: Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the majority of data points. It is important to identify and handle outliers as they can significantly impact the results of the ML model. Techniques for outlier detection include Z-score and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Capping and trimming are common techniques for handling outliers.

- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset can impact the results of the ML model. Techniques for missing value imputation include mean, median, mode, linear interpolation, adding a missing indicator, multivariate imputation, and imputation with scikit-learn and feature-engine.

- **Encoding**: Categorical variables can present a challenge in ML as many ML algorithms only accept numerical inputs. Encoding is the process of transforming categorical variables into numerical values. Techniques for encoding categorical variables include One hot encoding, ordinal encoding, target mean encoding, weight of evidence, and rare label encoding.

- **Handling Imbalanced Dataset**: Imbalanced datasets are those where one class of data points is significantly larger than the other. This can result in biased ML models. Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets include oversampling, undersampling, and synthesis.

- **Features Selection**: Feature selection is the process of selecting the most important features to use in the ML model. Techniques for feature selection include recursive feature elimination and feature importance using decision trees.

- **Standardization and Transformation**: Standardization involves transforming features to a common scale to prevent bias in the ML model. Techniques for standardization include normalization and standardization. Transformation involves transforming features to a different representation to improve the performance of the ML model. Techniques for transformation include log transformation, square root transformation, and Box-Cox transformation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EDA and FE are critical steps in the ML process that help to enhance the performance of the ML model. To demonstrate the application of EDA and FE, a sample dataset can be analyzed to identify outliers, missing values, and to perform encoding, feature selection, standardization, and transformation. The success of a ML model depends on the quality of the data, so EDA and Feature Engineering are essential steps in the ML process.
